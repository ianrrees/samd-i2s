* Condition defmt on a feature flag
* Make the serializer allocation dynamic based on supplied pins
* Optionally get the clock(s) from external sources
* Warn if clock divisions don't work out evenly
* Allow not configuring a sender/receiver
* Add an i2s master along the lines of tdm_master()
* Return result<> from send() instead of spinning, and implement a corresponding receive()
* Re-implementation of MasterClock::freq() seems strange...
* tdm_master() should accept the slot size as an argument
