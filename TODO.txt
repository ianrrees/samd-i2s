TODO for samd-i2s:

* Document
* Condition defmt on a feature flag
* Make the serializer allocation dynamic based on supplied pins
* Optionally get the clock(s) from external sources
* Warn if clock divisions don't work out evenly
* Allow not configuring a sender/receiver
* Add an i2s master along the lines of tdm_master()
* Implement a receive() like send()
* Re-implementation of MasterClock::freq() seems strange...
* Use Sealed as in https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd/issues/214
